Problem Statement (Word is Key)
One programming language has the following keywords that cannot be used as identifiers:

break, case, continue, default, defer, else, for, func, goto, if, map, range, return, struct, type, var

Write a program to find if the given word is a keyword or not


keys = ["break", "case", "continue", "default", "defer", "else", "for", 
"func", "goto", "if", "map", "range", "return", "struct", "type", "var"]

var = input()
if var in keys:
    print(var+ " is a keyword")
else:
    print(var+ " is a not keyword")
